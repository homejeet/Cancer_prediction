This is case study where i have used machine learning to solve cancer prediction
A cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is distinguish the mutations that contribute to tumor growth from neutral mutation. Currently this is done manually so its time consuming where pathologists has to do manually review and classifies every single genetic mutation. Here Machine Learning helps by using this base knowledge to classifies genetic variations.
